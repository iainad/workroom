# TODOs

## Live branch-label refresh (macapp)

**What:** Update each sidebar root row's branch/bookmark the moment it changes, rather
than on the throttled app-reactivate refresh.

**Why:** Today the root label resolves on load and refreshes (throttled) when the app
regains focus. If you switch branches in the root terminal and stay in the app, the label
is stale until you alt-tab away and back.

**How to start:** Per-project watcher — FSEvents on `<repo>/.git/HEAD` (git) and a `jj op
log` / `.jj/` watch (jj), debounced, re-running `BranchResolver` for that one project and
writing `AppStore.rootRefs[project.id]`. Tie the watchers' lifecycle to the project list.

**Depends on:** the `BranchResolver` + `rootRefs` machinery already in place
(`macapp/WorkroomApp/Core/BranchResolver.swift`, `Core/AppStore.swift`).

**Priority:** P3 (nicety — the throttled focus refresh covers the common case).

## Auto-emit OSC notifications on command completion (macapp)

**What:** An opt-in shell hook (zsh `precmd`/`preexec`, or OSC 133 prompt markers) that emits
`printf '\e]9;<cmd> finished\a'` after a command that ran longer than N seconds, so notifications
fire automatically without the user wrapping commands.

**Why:** Notification detection is explicit-only (issue #10 review, decision 1.1b): we notify on
OSC 9/99/777 + bell, not raw output. That's precise but silent for a bare `make test` that emits
nothing. A shell hook closes that gap so the common "my build finished" case just works.

**How to start:** Source a hook into the login shell launched by
`TerminalSessions.makeTerminal` (`-l`), or document it for the user to add. Decide OSC 133 vs a
`precmd` that emits OSC 9. Keep it opt-in (injecting into the user's shell is invasive).

**Depends on:** the notifications feature (issue #10) landing — the OSC 9 handler must exist to
receive it (`macapp/WorkroomApp/Core/ActivityTerminalView.swift`).

**Priority:** P3 (amplifies the shipped feature; the feature is useful without it for tools that
already emit OSC/bell).

## Notification preferences (macapp)

**What:** Per-workroom (or per-terminal) mute, a notification-sound toggle, and respecting macOS
Focus / Do-Not-Disturb.

**Why:** Once notifications exist, a noisy cooperating tool (a watcher firing OSC on every rebuild)
will need silencing without losing notifications from other terminals. Focus/DND respect is largely
automatic via `UNUserNotificationCenter`; per-workroom mute is app logic.

**How to start:** A mute set keyed on `TerminalTarget.ID`, checked in
`NotificationCenterStore.record(...)` before creating an item / posting. Persist with `@AppStorage`
(consistent with theme / copy-on-select). A sound toggle gates `content.sound` in `SystemNotifier`.

**Depends on:** the notifications feature (issue #10) landing
(`macapp/WorkroomApp/Core/NotificationCenterStore.swift`, `Core/SystemNotifier.swift`).

**Priority:** P3 (the feature is usable without it; add when a real terminal proves too chatty).
